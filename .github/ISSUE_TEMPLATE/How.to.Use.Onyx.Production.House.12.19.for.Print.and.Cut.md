## How to Install the Software and the Hardware Key
 
To use Onyx Production House 12 19, you need to install the software on your computer and connect the hardware key. The hardware key is a USB dongle that acts as a license to run the software. If you purchased an upgrade, you will not receive a new hardware key, but you will need to update your existing one with a link that will be emailed to you.
 
To install the software and the hardware key, follow these steps:

1. Insert the hardware key into a USB port on your computer. The key drivers will be installed with the software.
2. Plug in the Onyx USB flash drive that contains the installation program.
3. Open a file browser and go to the USB flash drive. Run `Install.exe`.

6. Optional - Change the pathâs drive letter if you want to install Onyx 12 on a different hard drive. Do not change the folder name.
7. In the lower right, check a mark your printers. If your printers are not listed, you can download them later using the Printer and Profile Download Manager.
8. Click the Install button to begin.
9. Click Finish when the installation has completed. RIP-Queue will automatically launch and the printers will need to be configured.

To print with Onyx Production House 12 19, you need to have printers and profiles installed. Printers are the devices that output your graphics, such as inkjet printers, plotters, or cutters. Profiles are sets of parameters that define how your printer handles different media types, such as vinyl, paper, or fabric.
 
You can download and install printers and profiles using the Printer and Profile Download Manager. This is a tool that allows you to access a library of printers and profiles from Onyx Graphics and other manufacturers. You can also create your own profiles using Media Manager.
 
To download and install printers and profiles, follow these steps:

1. In RIP-Queue, click on Tools > Printer & Profile Download Manager.
2. Select your printer manufacturer from the drop-down list.
